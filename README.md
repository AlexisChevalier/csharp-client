# Troubleshooting

The official BitPay API documentation should always be your first reference for development:
https://bitpay.com/downloads/bitpayApi.pdf

1. Verify that your "notificationURL" for the invoice is "https://" (not "http://")
2. Ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed on your server. Also ensure your root CA cert is
   updated. If your CA cert is not current, you will see curl SSL verification errors.
3. Verify that your callback handler at the "notificationURL" is properly receiving POSTs. You
   can verify this by POSTing your own messages to the server from a tool like Chrome Postman.
4. Verify that the POST data received is properly parsed and that the logic that updates the
   order status on the merchants web server is correct.
5. Verify that the merchants web server is not blocking POSTs from servers it may not
   recognize. Double check this on the firewall as well, if one is being used.
6. Use the logging functionality to log errors during development. If you contact BitPay support,
   they will ask to see the log file to help diagnose any problems.
7. Check the version of this PHP library agains the official repository to ensure you are using
   the latest version. Your issue might have been addressed in a newer version of the library.
8. If all else fails, send an email describing your issue *in detail* to support@bitpay.com
